## Usage
Results can be used to:
1. Deploy balanced GPU configurations meeting both throughput and latency requirements
2. Understand trade-offs between different performance objectives
3. Make informed decisions about constraint relaxation
4. Plan capacity with specific performance guarantees

## Constraint Types
The algorithm handles various constraints:
- **Throughput Constraints**: Minimum requests per second
- **Latency Constraints**: Maximum response time bounds
- **Resource Constraints**: GPU, memory, and network limitations
- **Power Constraints**: Energy consumption limits
- **Cost Constraints**: Budget limitations

## Pareto Optimization
The algorithm finds configurations that are:
- **Pareto Optimal**: Cannot improve one objective without degrading another
- **Constraint Feasible**: Satisfy all specified constraints
- **Efficient**: Provide the best possible trade-offs

*Note: This directory will be populated as the optimization algorithm runs and generates results.*
