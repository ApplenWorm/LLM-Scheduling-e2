## Key Metrics
- **P50 Latency**: Median response time
- **P95 Latency**: 95th percentile response time
- **P99 Latency**: 99th percentile response time
- **GPU Computation Time**: Time spent on GPU processing
- **Memory Access Time**: Time for memory operations
- **Network Communication Time**: Inter-island communication overhead
- **Queue Processing Time**: Time spent in request queues

## File Naming Convention
- `config_[timestamp]_[algorithm_version].json` - Configuration files
- `latency_[timestamp]_[test_id].csv` - Latency measurement results
- `analysis_[metric]_[date].pdf` - Analysis reports

## Usage
Results can be used to:
1. Deploy low-latency GPU configurations in production
2. Identify latency bottlenecks in the system
3. Optimize for real-time applications
4. Meet SLA requirements for response times

## Latency Components
The algorithm analyzes and optimizes:
- **GPU Processing Latency**: Model inference time
- **Memory Latency**: Data transfer and access times
- **Network Latency**: Inter-island communication
- **Queue Latency**: Request queuing and scheduling
- **Pipeline Latency**: End-to-end processing pipeline

*Note: This directory will be populated as the optimization algorithm runs and generates results.*
