# Throughput Optimization Results

This directory contains results from the **Throughput Optimization Algorithm**.

## Objective
Maximize the number of requests processed per unit time by finding optimal GPU island configurations.

## Expected Results Files

### Configuration Results
- `optimal_configurations.json` - Best GPU island configurations found
- `configuration_matrix.csv` - Matrix of all tested configurations
- `performance_metrics.json` - Throughput metrics for each configuration

### Analysis Files
- `throughput_analysis.pdf` - Detailed throughput analysis
- `resource_utilization.csv` - GPU and memory utilization data
- `scalability_curves.png` - Throughput vs. load curves
- `optimization_convergence.png` - Algorithm convergence plots

### Comparative Studies
- `baseline_comparison.csv` - Comparison with baseline configurations
- `improvement_analysis.md` - Analysis of performance improvements
- `trade_off_analysis.pdf` - Throughput vs. resource usage trade-offs

## Key Metrics
- **Maximum Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **GPU Utilization**: Percentage of GPU resources used
- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory usage patterns
- **Network Efficiency**: Inter-island communication overhead
- **Scalability Factor**: Performance improvement with scale

## File Naming Convention
- `config_[timestamp]_[algorithm_version].json` - Configuration files
- `results_[timestamp]_[test_id].csv` - Performance results
- `analysis_[metric]_[date].pdf` - Analysis reports

## Usage
Results can be used to:
1. Deploy optimal GPU configurations in production
2. Understand throughput bottlenecks
3. Plan capacity expansion
4. Benchmark new hardware configurations

*Note: This directory will be populated as the optimization algorithm runs and generates results.*
