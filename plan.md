# Project Plan: GPU Configuration Optimization Algorithms

## Executive Summary

This project implements three optimization algorithms to find optimal GPU configurations for creating efficient processing islands that handle Large Language Model (LLM) requests. The algorithms focus on different optimization objectives: throughput maximization, latency minimization, and constrained optimization.

## Problem Statement

Large Language Models require significant computational resources, often distributed across multiple GPUs. The challenge is to configure these GPUs into optimal "islands" that can efficiently process requests while meeting specific performance requirements (throughput, latency, or both).

## Algorithm Overview

  - Network topology between islands
  - Load balancing configuration
- **Constraints**:
  - Total available GPUs
  - Memory limitations
  - Power consumption limits
  - Network bandwidth constraints

**Methodology**:
1. **Initialization**: Generate random GPU island configurations
2. **Evaluation**: Calculate throughput for each configuration using:
   - Request processing capacity per GPU
   - Network transfer overhead
   - Load balancing efficiency
   - Memory utilization patterns
3. **Optimization**: Use genetic algorithm or simulated annealing to:
   - Mutate configurations
   - Crossover successful configurations
